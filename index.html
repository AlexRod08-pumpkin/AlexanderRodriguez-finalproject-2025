     <ol>
       <li>More Customers:International trade can allow companies to sell their products to more people, which means they can earn more money. For example, if a company sells its product in one country, it may be able to sell it in other countries too. As a result, the company will have more customers and make more money than if it only sold in one country.</li>
    <li>More Sales:If your product is sold internationally, then more people will be able to buy it. This means more revenue for your company and more products sold overall. It also means that there's an opportunity for you to expand into other markets and become even more profitable than before.</li>
